## Description

A Discord bot to facilitate auctions. It allows users to create auction events,
place bids, and manage auction processes seamlessly.

## Features

- **Auction Creation**: Users can create auction events with specific items,
  starting bids, and duration.
- **Bid Handling**: The bot handles bids, ensuring they meet
  the minimum increment and are placed within the auction duration.
- **Auction Timer**: A countdown for each auction, notifying participants
  as the auction nears its end.

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the Project Plutus Discord bot, follow these steps:

1. **Set up a Discord bot account**:
   - Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
   - Click on the "New Application" button and give it a name.
   - Go to the "Bot" tab and click on "Add Bot". Confirm the creation.
   - Save the token provided as you will need it to run your bot.

2. **Invite the bot to your server**:
   - In the Developer Portal, navigate to the "OAuth2" tab.
   - Under "Scopes", select "bot".
   - In the "Bot Permissions" section, select the permissions your bot will need.
   - Copy the generated URL and open it in your browser to invite the bot
    to your server.

3. **Set up the bot environment**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system. (Tested on Python 3.10)
   - Install the required Python packages with `pip install .`.
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Discord bot
    token like so:

     ```env
     DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
     ```

4. **Running the bot**:
   - Run the bot with `py bot.py` from the command line.

5. **Verify bot status**:
   - After running the bot, it should appear online in your Discord server.
   - Test the bot's functionality with the `$help` command to ensure
    it's working properly.
